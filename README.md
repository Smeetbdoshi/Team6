Poject title: GET MOBILE
Summary of the Project: In this era of the internet, e-commerce keeps growing. An e-commerce website will put our company and products in the hands of consumers no matter where they are and which device they’re using. Whenever a customer needs a new mobile phone we’ll sell, all they need to do is open their laptop or smartphone, browse through our website and purchase the products they desire. The main aim is to sell mobile phones by creating a larger market, lowering the cost and it could scale up quickly and have unlimited shelf space.

•	To design an online mobile phone e-commerce website system. 
•	To provide a purchase solution for the mobile customers.

Back-End:
•	PHP

The primary technologies used for front-end web development are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web pages are composed of HTML for their structure and content, CSS for their styling and layout, and JavaScript for their interactive and dynamic behaviour.
Popular options for back-end web development include PHP and MySQL. PHP is a language for creating server-side scripts that can be used to handle form submissions, build dynamic web pages, and communicate with databases. With the help of the database management system MySQL, programmers may save and retrieve data from databases.
For front-end development, developers can design aesthetically pleasing and interactive web pages that function in any browser by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For controlling server-side activities and storing and managing data, PHP and MySQL offer a potent back-end solution.
These technologies work together to create a full-stack web development solution that can run a variety of online apps. Developers can construct modular, scalable apps that are simpler to maintain and upgrade over time by separating the front-end and back-end development.
